          <div question>What is baseimage-amzn Docker Base Image?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              baseimage-amzn is the second project we are announcing under the Lambda Linux Project umbrella.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometime back, we wanted a Docker Base Image based on Amazon Linux RPM packages to make our container based development and deployment workflow on AWS more efficient and secure. It seemed like there was a <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=725944">need</a> for a secure, stable Docker Base Image based on Amazon Linux packages.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we created baseimage-amzn.
            </p>
            <p>
              baseimage-amzn is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/">baseimage-docker</a> project. We would like to say thank you to Phusion for providing some good ideas and code. We would also like to say thank you to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/">Amazon Linux AMI Team</a> for providing excellent Amazon Linux RPM packages.

          <div question>What is Extra Packages for Amazon Linux (EPLL) repository?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              Extra Packages for Amazon Linux (EPLL) is the first project we are announcing under the Lambda Linux Project umbrella.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to create high quality set of additional packages that complements <code>amzn*.repo</code> package repositories.

          <div question>What is Lambda Linux Project?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>Lambda Linux is a community project sponsored by Atihita Inc.</p>
            <p>A while back we realized that Amazon Linux is an excellent server-style operating system. Given all the innovation that is happening on AWS and EC2, we felt that it was a bit strange that there is no vibrant open source community around Amazon Linux.</p>
            <p>One thing led to another and we now have <i>Lambda Linux Project</i>. We look forward to creating a welcoming, commercial friendly, open-source community.</p>
            <p>Btw, we have to clarify that &ndash; <i>Lambda Linux Project is not related to, affiliated with, sponsored or endorsed by Amazon Web Services, Inc.</i></p>

            <p>
              In Lambda Linux Project we understand, agree and appreciate many of the design decisions that Amazon has taken around &ndash; Minimal Operating System, Security Configuration and Updates, Multiple Package/Library Versions, Rolling Releases, etc.,
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that these decisions will play a crucial role as we enter the new world of application specific virtual machines, containers, cloud security and devops. When building our packages and images, we look forward to learning as much as we can from Amazon Linux packages and repositories.

          <div question>How is the Lambda Linux different from Amazon Linux?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              On most technical and design issues, Lambda Linux is not that different from Amazon Linux. We consider this as a feature, not a bug! The <i>key difference</i> perhaps is that we are an open-source project, where our direction us driven by our users and contributors.

        </div>

        <faqs-question-answer>
          <div question>Why should I use baseimage-amzn instead of a Docker Image based on Ubuntu, RedHat, Debian or CentOS?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              To us this discussion comes down to three aspects &ndash; operational security, trust and availability of newer & multiple package versions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ubuntu, RedHat, Debian, CentOS are designed to be general purpose Linux distributions. In contrast Amazon Linux is designed as a <i>minimal server-style rolling</i> Linux distribution. The design of Amazon Linux naturally provides much smaller exploit surface area when compared to general purpose Linux distributions. You can estimate the exploit surface area of a distribution by looking at the following metric - <i>number of CVEs per distribution per month</i>. Smaller exploit surface area is more easier to secure and automate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Minimizing the number of entities we trust is a security best practice. By using AWS we are directly or in-directly trusting Amazon Linux. baseimage-amzn lets us extend our existing chain of trust with Amazon Linux to the container layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amazon Linux is a <i>stable</i> rolling distribution. It provides the latest and multiple versions of language runtimes, databases and other packages. This allows us to decouple application dependent packages and language runtimes from OS dependent packages. Package and language runtime migrations can be managed at their own cadence. By providing a Docker based workflow, with baseimage-amzn we further simplify management and packaging of application dependencies.

        <faqs-question-answer>
          <div question>What packages can I expect in Extra Packages for Amazon Linux (EPLL) repository?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              You can expect to see following kinds of packages,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Packages used by the AWS EC2 community, but not available in <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories</p></li>
              <li><p>Packages useful to our users that landed in Red Hat&reg; Extras repository instead of Fedora's EPEL repository</p></li>
              <li><p>Packages from Fedora's EPEL repository that breaks when used with <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            We are a open-source project. So, you can also contribute and maintain packages on behalf of our community.

          <div question>How can I get security and other updates?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              Our end-user security is extremely important to us. Security updates and other package updates are made available in the yum repositories. You can use <code>yum updateinfo</code> commands to identify and apply updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will also provide a security portal similar to <a href="https://alas.aws.amazon.com/index.html">Amazon Linux AMI Security Center</a> and a RSS feed. Please stay tuned!

            <p>
              All source RPMs (SRPMs) are available in yum repositories. You can use <code>yumdownloader --enablerepo=epll-source --source &lt;package_name&gt;</code> to download SRPM package.

        <faqs-question-answer>
          <div question>Will EPLL packages be supported alongside with Fedora's EPEL packages?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              No. We build, qualify and support our packages only against <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories. You can think of EPLL as a community driven <i>layered product</i> on top of <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories.

        <faqs-question-answer>
          <div question>How are duplicate packages handled?</div>
          <div answer>
            <p>
              In general we avoid introducing duplicate packages (with the same RPM <i>name</i> and <i>version</i>) in EPLL repositories that might be present in <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
              However occasionally in order to support certain packages, we might introduce a newer <i>version</i> of an existing package that might be present in <code>amzn*.repo</code> repositories. These newer versions of packages are documented <a href="https://github.com/lambda-linux-pkgs/epll-release/wiki/Newer-Packages-Present-in-EPLL-Repository">here</a>. Once a package, originally in EPLL, lands in <code>amzn*.repo</code>, we will deprecate and remove it from EPLL repository. This process should be very seamless to you, our users.

            <ul>

                <p>We aim to deliver free, secure, stable and latest software to our users all the time</p>
                <p>This is a very important distinction because we think it is the right thing to do for our users.</p>
                <p>To our critics who might say <i>it cannot be done!</i> We kindly ask you to <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">give it five minutes</a> and learn from Amazon Linux.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We are focused only on server-style use-cases</p>
                <p>This means &ndash; container, cloud, server and data center. There is no workstation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We are not controlled by Red Hat&reg; Inc.</p>
                <p>While many things are yet to evolve, our governance structure will be very simple and modeled along the lines of &ndash; PostgreSQL and Linux Kernel project.</p>
